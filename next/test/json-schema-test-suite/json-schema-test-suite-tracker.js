 * On top of our test cases, we're running the JSON-Schema-Test-Suite
 * (https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/tree/main/tests/draft2020-12).
 * However, until all features are implemented, some of the
 * tests in this suite would fail. We're using this reporter to keep track of the
 * tests that are failing (on the JSON_SCHEMA_SUITE_FAILED_TESTS_FILE_NAME), so we
 * can re-enable them once the feature is implemented.
 *
 * Note: The failed tests are not being saved to file every time the suite runs,
 * as this could cause for bugs to surface due to a change in the codebase.
 * The SHOULD_WRITE_FAILED_TESTS_TO_FILE constant can be set to true to write the
 * failed tests to a file (on-demand), for later consumption at the
 * json_schema_test_suite.test.js file.
